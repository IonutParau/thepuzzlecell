# Translation Help

This markdown file is to help people make their own translations. It explains what each field in the JSON actually is for.

## How do I get cell and button IDs?

Cell, Category and Subcategory IDs are revealed by enabling debug mode in the game's settings.
The button IDs can be found in the code, and this markdown file will also slow them

## Translation variables

In the text, @variablename gets replaced with the variable.

## Example of JSON

Translations use the JSON markup language.
It is a markup language for describing objects with a syntax similar-ish to JavaScript's objects.

Simple example:

```json
{
  "field": "content"
}
```

Those curly brackets (aka `{` and `}`) are only at the start it to mark it as an object.

When typing multiple field-value pairs, add commas inbetween them.
Like so:

```json
{
  "field": "content",
  "other_field": "other content"
}
```

The last field-value pair must not have a , at the end or the parser fails and you get an error.

Hope this helped you!
