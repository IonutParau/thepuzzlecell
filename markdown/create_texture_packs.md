# Creating a Texture Pack

## Making the folder

Go to the Texture Packs menu and click on Create.
Then, specify the ID and Title.

### What is ID for?

ID is just the name of the actual folder.

### What is Title?

It's the title the texture pack is going to be displayed with.

## Adding cells

Because TPC supports multiple texture packs existing at once, each texture pack must specify which cells they wish to modify.
They also need to specify where the files are.
This can be complicated to do manually, however, TPC has a way to do it automatically.

Click next to your texture pack the button called "Modify" and then you can modify the texture pack.
You can scroll to find a cell you want to modify and click "Create" to automatically handle that creating of the file and telling TPC that cell will be modified automatically! Not only that but you can also Delete one if you no longer want to modify the textures.

### Where are the files created?

They are created based on where the normal textures are in TPC's internal files.

## How do I edit those files?

You click "Open", and it'll open the texture pack's folder.

## How do I send my texture pack to others?

You click "Package", and it'll create a ZIP archive and ask where you'd like to save it. Then, simply upload that ZIP!
