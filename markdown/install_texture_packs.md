## "What are the Modify, Package and Open buttons for?"

Modify is used to add new cells to the Texture Pack automatically.
This is only meant to be used by those who create and maintain their own texture packs.

Package is used to properly compress a texture pack into a ZIP archive. This is only meant to be used for those who want to create and distribute their own texture packs.

Open is used to open the folder containing the files of the Texture Pack in your file manager, to do stuff such as edit the images or change the `pack.json`.
