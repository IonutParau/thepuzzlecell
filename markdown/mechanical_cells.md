# What are Mechanical Cells?

Mechanical Cells are cells that use the mechanical signal system.
This means that there is a cell that outputs a signal, and a cell that does something when it gets a signal.

# How can a signal be carried?

Mechanical Gears will transfer over a signal, but they have a maximum range.
If you need to carry them for longer, we recommend using some kind of signal extender.

# How do mechanical logic gates work?

They compare whether gears on their inputs are on and based on which are on will give an output as a signal in front. Most logic gates take 2 inputs, which are at left and right.

NOT takes one input (at the back) and outputs a signal if that signal is off.

AND outputs a signal if both inputs are on.

NAND outputs a signal if either none or only one input is on.

OR outputs a signal if either input is on.

NOR outputs a signal if both inputs are off.

XOR outputs a signal if exactly one input is on.

XNOR outputs a signal if none or both inputs are on.

IMPLY outputs a signal if either left input is off or the right input is on.

NIMPLY outputs a signal if the left input is on and the right input is off.

# How do Displayers work?

You give them a signal and they will emit a Pixel signal out. When that pixel signal hits a pixel it will turn it on. You can also give it a "bias" by putting some number of backgrounds in front of it in a line, which will tell it how many pixels to ignore before turning on the next one.

# What can you make with Mechanical?

Basically anything! You can build a processor, a display, or just add some simple logic to a creation.
